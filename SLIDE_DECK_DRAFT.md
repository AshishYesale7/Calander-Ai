## Slide 2: The Problem

<br/>

### 🚨 Work is Fragmented. Productivity is Broken.

<br/>

| Icon | Pain Point | Description |
| :--: | :--- | :--- |
| ⛓️ | **Fragmented Workflows** | Employees waste countless hours juggling calendars, Google Drive, Gmail, Slack, and project tools. |
| 🧠 | **Constant Context Switching** | Context is scattered. Files and emails are disconnected from the meetings they belong to, forcing mental overhead. |
| 😴 | **Meeting Fatigue** | Calendars today are "dumb containers." They don't understand priorities, workload balance, or team productivity, leading to endless, inefficient meetings. |
| ❌ | **Broken Feedback Loops** | Decisions made in meetings rarely flow back into actionable tasks or schedules, causing misalignment and rework. |

## Slide 3: The Cost of Chaos

<br/>

### 💸 The True Cost of Inefficiency

<br/>

- **Massive Productivity Loss:** Studies show knowledge workers lose up to **40%** of their productive time to context switching.
- **Wasted Hours:** Employees spend an average of **5 hours per week** just scheduling and rescheduling meetings.
- **Poor Visibility:** It's impossible to know who decided what, where the latest work lives, or how team time is actually being spent.
- **Employee Burnout:** Constant meeting fatigue and inefficient processes are leading drivers of burnout in the tech industry.
