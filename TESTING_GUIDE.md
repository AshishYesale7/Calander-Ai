# Calendar.ai - Testing Guide

Welcome, and thank you for helping test Calendar.ai! This guide will help you log into the application using the available methods.

## How to Log In for Testing

Due to the application being in a development phase, some login methods are restricted. Please use one of the following methods to access the app.

### Method 1: Use the Default Test Account (Phone Login)

2.  Select the option to sign in with a phone number.

    *   **OTP / Verification Code:** `123456`
4.  You will be logged into the pre-configured test account.

*Note: This is a shared account, so please be mindful of any changes you make.*

### Method 2: Use Your Own Microsoft Account

You can also sign in using your personal or work/school Microsoft account.

1.  Navigate to the [Sign In](https://futuresight-8ebba4468907.herokuapp.com/auth/signin) or [Sign Up](https://futuresight-8ebba4468907.herokuapp.com/auth/signup) page.
2.  Click the "Sign in with Microsoft" button.
3.  Follow the prompts to log in with your Microsoft credentials.

## Restricted Login Methods

*   **Google Login:** The Google login flow is currently restricted because the application is in a "non-verified" state within Google Cloud Platform. This is a standard security measure from Google for apps in development. Only pre-approved testers can use this method.
*   **General Phone Authentication:** While a test phone number is provided, general sign-up with any phone number may be restricted.
