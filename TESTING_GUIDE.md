# Calendar.ai - Comprehensive Testing & Navigation Guide

Welcome to Calendar.ai! This guide is designed to walk you through the key features of the application and help you get the most out of your testing experience.

### Method 1: Use the Default Test Account (Phone Login)

### Restricted Login Methods & Early Tester Program

*   **Google & General Phone Login:** The Google login flow and general phone authentication are currently restricted because the application is in a "non-verified" state within Google Cloud Platform. This is a standard security measure from Google for apps in development. Only pre-approved testers can use these methods.

If you are interested in becoming an official early tester with full access, please reach out to us!

## 2. Getting Started: The Dashboard & User Roles

### The Index Page (Your Dashboard)

Once you log in, you will land on the main **Dashboard**. This is your central hub, composed of several interactive **widgets**.

### Choosing Your Role: Student vs. Professional

Calendar.ai offers two tailored experiences. You can switch between them at any time from the **user menu in the sidebar**:

*   **Student Dashboard:** Focused on academic and career-launching features. It includes the **Daily Streak** widget and the **Leaderboard** to gamify your progress.
*   **Professional Dashboard:** Geared towards productivity and team collaboration, with a layout that prioritizes meetings, emails, and project tracking.

### Dashboard Customization: Widgets

Your dashboard is fully customizable.
*   **Drag & Drop:** Click and hold the top handle of any widget to drag it to a new position on the grid.
*   **Resize:** Drag the bottom-right corner of any widget to resize it.
*   **Manage Widgets:** Access the "Widgets" popover from the header to hide or show specific widgets to tailor the dashboard to your needs.

## 3. Core Features Walkthrough

### The AI Daily Scheduler Card

This is the heart of your dashboard.
*   **Smart Planning:** It provides an AI-generated, personalized schedule for your day.
*   **3-Day Horizon:** The AI can plan up to three days in advance, analyzing your upcoming events, tasks from Google Tasks, and important deadlines from your Gmail to intelligently schedule focus time.

### Maximized Planner View

For deep planning, you can enter the **full-screen timeline viewer**:
*   Click the "Maximize" icon on the "Day Timetable" widget.
*   This opens a multi-panel, distraction-free planner where you can manage your week, view your Gmail inbox, and drag-and-drop tasks or emails directly onto your calendar to create events.

### Communication Suite: Chat & Calling

*   **Real-time Messaging:** Follow other users to start a one-on-one chat. The chat sidebar on the right shows your contacts and their online status.
*   **Voice & Video Calls:** Initiate a direct peer-to-peer voice or video call with any contact from the chat panel.

### The AI Command Bar (Desktop Power-Up)

Press **`Cmd+K`** (on Mac) or **`Ctrl+K`** (on Windows) to activate the floating **AI Command Bar**. This is your central nervous system for the app.
*   **Movable & Resizable:** Drag it anywhere on your screen.
*   **AI Chat Interface:** It’s not just a command palette; it’s a full-featured AI chat interface powered by multiple models and a Multi-Context Processing (MCP) engine.
*   **File System Access:** Open the "Files" tab within the bar to access a virtual file system.
*   **Natural Language Commands:** Create new tasks and events just by typing, e.g., *"remind me to call the team tomorrow at 3pm."*
